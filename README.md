# Voice Recognition
Project to learn and understand how to add speech recognition.
Words that you want to receive as a command are designated in the editor, and when you mention them they will appear in the text in the middle (in this case they are only shown on the screen but the functionality could be added for anything like opening doors or executing a action in a video game).
